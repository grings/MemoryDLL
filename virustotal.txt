VirtusTotal report for MemoryDLL Project
=============================================================================

We are pleased to include a VirusTotal report for this project to ensure
transparency and trust. Every effort is made to deliver software that is both
safe and free of viruses. However, despite our rigorous testing and security
measures, there is always a possibility that virus scanners may flag the
files as a false positive. We appreciate your understanding and encourage you
to review the VirusTotal report for your assurance. Should you have any
concerns or reservations, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.
